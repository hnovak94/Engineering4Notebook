# Engineering IV Notebook


## Code

### Hello Python

[Code](https://github.com/hnovak94/Engineering4Notebook/blob/main/diceroller%20(1).py)

[Spicy Code](https://github.com/hnovak94/Engineering4Notebook/blob/main/spicydr.py)
  
#### Assignment Description

This assignment we shifted away from working in Beagleterm, and began using and online [python IDE](https://www.online-python.com/) to code. The task was to code an automatic dice roller that would produce a random number between 1 and 6. 

The spicier version of this assignment offers the user the option to choose the number of sides and the number of die rolled.

#### Reflection

For this assignment we had to start using functions again, and it was a return to coding after months away. 

The spicier version was done by creating more inputs (for number of sides and number of dice) and the use of nested if loops. 


### Python Program 01

[Code](https://github.com/hnovak94/Engineering4Notebook/blob/main/calculator.py) 

#### Assignment Description

The task for this assignment was to create a calculator on python where you could enter two values and the function doMath would give you the sum, the difference, the product, the quotient, and the modulo. The modulo is the remainder of a division problem, division without decimals.

#### Reflection

The modulo is found using "%". [This article](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/calculator) was very helpful in getting started. An issue with this assignment was the cannot concatenate error. [This article](https://careerkarma.com/blog/python-typeerror-can-only-concatenate-str-not-int-to-str/) was very helpful with this issue. I had to convert the returns at the end to strings using str().
