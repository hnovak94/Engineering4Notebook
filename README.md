# Engineering IV Notebook


## Code

### Hello Python

  [Code](https://github.com/hnovak94/Engineering4Notebook/blob/main/diceroller%20(1).py)

This assignment we shifted away from working in Beagleterm, and began using and online [python IDE](https://www.online-python.com/) to code. The task was to code an automatic dice roller that would produce a random number between 1 and 6. 

[Spicy Code](https://github.com/hnovak94/Engineering4Notebook/blob/main/spicy_diceroller.py)

The spicier version of this assignment offers the user the option to choose the number of sides and the number of die rolled. This was done by creating more inputs and the use of nested if loops.
